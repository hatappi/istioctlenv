# Istioctl Version Management: istioctlenv

istioctlenv aims to be as simple as possible and follow the already established
successful version management model of [goenv](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv) and [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

This project was cloned from [goenv](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv) and modified for istioctl.

### istioctlenv _does..._

* Let you **change the global istioctl version** on a per-user basis.
* Provide support for **per-project istioctl versions**.
* Allow you to **override the istioctl version** with an environment
  variable.
* Search commands from **multiple versions of istioctl at a time**.
